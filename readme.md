# Angular Blog
---

simple bloggins software using angular and firebase.
the idea is to create a simple alternative to bloggin software like ghost but make it template friendly and host friendly.
so iv turned into using angular and for the backend im using firebase. so the blog can run on a simple webserver. just need to run the html actually.

developers can add components as simple directive files
